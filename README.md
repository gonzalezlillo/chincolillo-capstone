# Chincolillo: Prototype
### Capstone Project for Web Design Specialization at University of Michigan - Coursera
#### 2020, december

In this final project, I put into practice the knowledge acquired in the **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript** and **Responsive Design** Courses.
Additionally and beyond the minimum requirements, I used **Bootstrap 4** and created a **Wordpress** theme.

It is the prototype for a personal project with my portfolio about photographs and other records of birds from Chile.
